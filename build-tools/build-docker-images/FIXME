loci/patches:
- loci/patches/0001-starlingx-wheels-from-filesystem-pkg-repos.patch : this patch
  makes docker images very large when COPY'ing a local wheels tarball.
- Remove all patches; or re-work & merge upstream & then switch to an upstream loci.
  They may not apply to Loci/master as is; and they have problems as well as
  some STX-specific functionality.
